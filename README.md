Source for the site. Theme used is "even" currently; probably will change it
later. The custom versions of the files changed in that theme are in _sass_ and
_templates_ dirs.

_Makefile_ is there to automate stuff.

Homepage is a view-source copy from Hugo-Coder theme's demo site, with its
associated css files.
