My full name is _Satheesh Babu Vattekkat_, but since 2010, most people including 
myself have forgotten the _Babu_ and the whole thing is now compressed to _SV_.

## How is this built?
* On [LG Gram 14Z980](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B07GXYYVZF/) laptop, bought on December 2018,  running 
  [ElementaryOS Hera 5.1](https://blog.elementary.io/introducing-elementary-os-5-1-hera/) with my
  [post OS installation](../elementary_hera_postinstall) steps.
  Default dual-boot installation with Windows 10 that the laptop shipped with works flawlessly.
* Content is written using [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).
* Often typed using [Royal Kludge RK 61
  keyboard](https://www.banggood.in/Royal-Kludge-RK61-bluetooth-Wired-Dual-Mode-60-RGB-Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard-p-1353613.html?ID=224515632&cur_warehouse=CN).
* Edited using [neovim](https://neovim.io/), with my  _[.vimrc](https://github.com/vsbabu/configs/blob/master/vim/vimrc.light)_,
  often under [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux), with my
  _[tmux.conf](https://github.com/vsbabu/configs/tree/master/tmux)_.
* Static site is generated using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) with
  [Even](https://www.getzola.org/themes/even/) theme customized with my colors.
