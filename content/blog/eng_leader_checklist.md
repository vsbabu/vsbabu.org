This is generally the mindmap I follow when leading a team/org. Sharing, if it helps any others building/leading an engineering team. Depending upon where the team, product are and how my own skills fit into the mix, I used to assign different priorities to these leaf nodes and then track on a weekly basis to reflect and re-assign priorities and identify next actions/goals.

This assumes you are a hands-on leader who doesn't shy away from building, debugging and reviewing code on your own. There are pros and cons to being a hands-on vs hands-off manager depending upon the situation and I am not getting into debates on how one should operate :)
